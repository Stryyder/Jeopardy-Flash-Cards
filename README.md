# Jeopardy
Create your own Jeopardy game using Flash

To use this, just download it all and run Board2.html

The first few screens are for setting up the game (contestants don't watch!)
Questions/Answers and all other variables are stored in variables.txt

This could definitely use some polish, but it was a great project to work on years ago

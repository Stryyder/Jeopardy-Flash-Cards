# Jeopardy
Create your own Jeopardy game using Flash

To use this, just download it all and run Board2.html

The first few screens are for setting up the game (contestants don't watch!)

Questions/Answers were intended to be stored in variables.txt file so that they could be preloaded


## Future

There are no plans to continue work on this project as is using this environment, however an updated version utilizing a better skeleton would be interesting
